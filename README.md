## Inspiration
Covid 19 Pandemic was the worst disaster in recent Human History. The scale of loss was further compounded due to lack of information and awareness among general populace.
 With impending third wave, it is critical to make people aware of the massive scale of the disaster. 

## What it does
The app serves as an interactive Covid 19 dashboard that is updated in real time from the data from Joh Hopkins, Moreover we have implemented a Twilio and Tweepy powered subscription which enables a user to get regular updated from a target location regarding Covid.

## How we built it
It is built via dash-plotly server, with integration from twilio and tweepy

## Challenges we ran into
The database integration in dash server was a bit tricky, but currently we have created a workaround using csv files.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Making something that updates in real time and is informational for general public

## What we learned
Api integration and testing

## What's next for Covid DashBoard
A full scale app with managed database and further modules to target cleanliness promote good hygiene practices
